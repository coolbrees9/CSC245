The compression algorithm used is the huffman encoding. 

This compression builds a huffman tree and based on that tree, it will make an encoding table with every character listed, their frequency, parent, and their child type.

The ASCII code will be printed along with a binary code for each. Below that will be the binary code of the file based on the ASCII.

You will then be able to unzip the file and restore everything previous to the zip.
