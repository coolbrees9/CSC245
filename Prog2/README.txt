The goal of my client is to create a postfix desk calculator. It does this by using a Stack class allowing the user to input numbers and some math operators.

The input from the user will start out with numbers and whenever an operator is entered the last 2 numbers in the Stack will do that operayot. When you print the Stack it will print vertically the numbers present and if any have been changed by an operator it will have the new number above the other numbers.

The client will have a p command that will print the value on the top of stack ten pop it off and newline is printed after value. The n command prints the value on top of stack and not create a newline after. The f command prints the entire content of stack without altering anything, newline is printed after each value. The c command clears the stack making it empty. A d command will duplicate value on top of stack and pushes another copy of it. The r reverses the order of top two values on stack. The operatorss will do what they are used for in math (+, -, *, /, %) and push the new value from the top 2 values in stack. Ex. 2 3 + will push 5.

My client will have a main method that calls all other methods in the file. There will be a method for each command that will be called in the main using a switch to check which command is entered. The best way to start is by using the push and pop methods for each command.Then use error handling to check for anything the user might have entered that was not part of the list of commands. A try and catch will be used to check for errors with user input and also any Stack errors like seg faults.
